# discord-custom-status-changer
custom status changer coded in node js

# installation
* install node js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* clone this repository
* install dependencies (npm install)
* edit config file with your token and custom statuses
* node index.js

# information
* the code is very simple and easy to understand for people who want to learn
* this tool allows you to change your custom status every 15 seconds (can be changed, not recommended)
* to add more statuses simply add another element to the array, for example: `"a", "b", "c", "d"` for 4 statuses
* to change the time (again, not recommended) change `15000` to whatever you like

# legal
This is considered against Discord Terms of Service because its automating a user account. It does comply to Discords 15 second limit with changing statuses but it's still a bannable offence, use at your own risk. I am not responsible for what happens to your account if you decide to use this tool.
